### `Tic-Tac-Toe`

This is my first solo project, which I have created in a span of three days.

## Unique Features

1) Implementation of `Timer`, we can set the time limit per move, once the player is not able to make a move within the limit, the other player would win the match.

2) We can change the the names of the players dynamically.

## Key Learnings

Implementation of the `timeOuts` and `timeIntervals` is like playing with fire. Every step has to be taken very carefully while implementing them, a single mistake can crash the whole output.


## Features to be added in Future

Implementation of web-sockets to make this truly multiplayer, and chatting feature will we added too.
